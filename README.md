Run Minecraft on USB, in a standalone folder
This standalone of original launcher of Minecraft will work on ONE folder, just one.

You will can install mods, and all the things you can normally! (shaders, resource packs, worlds saves)

# How to install
It's simple:

1 - Open the 'minecraftstart.bat', not 'Minecraft.exe' in the '\bin' it will create '.minecraft' folder in '%appdata%'.

2 - Wait for the updates of the Launcher

3 - And it's done! connect to your Microsoft Account and do what you do normally!

Note: (The '.minecraft' folder is in '\data' folder, you can import your worlds in, your mods, ect)

If you want install Optifine, Iris Shaders (It's possible!):

1 - On Optifine .jar installer, target the .minecraft in the '\data' folder, same for Iris, Forge, Fabric.
